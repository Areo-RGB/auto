# Automation Setup

## Environment

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) to supply your DFBnet credentials:

```
DFBNET_USERNAME=your-username
DFBNET_PASSWORD=your-password
```

These values are loaded automatically by the automation when credentials are not provided explicitly through `RunOptions`.
